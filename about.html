        <div id="info">EcoDouble is both shampoo & conditioner in one bottle. And itÂ´s eco-friendly!

Shampoo and conditioner contributes to waste (plastic), and several dangerous chemicals are released into our nature. EcoDouble is an environmentally friendly shampoo & conditioner all in one. 

Our shampoo and conditioner only contains organic ingredients. Our products are 100% vegan. The bottles for our products are made of recycled plastic with good quality, so our bottles are reusable. To contribute to a better environment, we recommend buying our refill bags. Our refill bags are also made from recycled material.
